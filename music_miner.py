# Gameplay Mechanics
st.header("3. Gameplay Mechanics")
st.write("""
- **Digging Mechanism:** Players control a miner character who navigates underground. As they dig deeper, they encounter different levels filled with rocks, soil, and gems.
- **Match-Three Core Mechanic:** The underground is filled with different minerals and gemstones (coins, pearls, gold nuggets, platinum, and diamonds). To collect these treasures, players need to match three or more of the same item by swapping adjacent treasures.
- **Special Items:**
  - **Diamond Balls:** Create a chain reaction that clears an entire row or column.
  - **Platinum Balls:** Trigger a temporary bonus, like a multiplier for treasure value.
- **Combo System:** Matches create musical notes or beats, and forming chains builds the game's background music. Bigger combos produce richer and more complex sound layers.
